# Masai School Construct Week Project

Welcome, we're are team , and this Readme contains details about our project. We‘ve built a cloned website of toggl/track.com with some of its basic functionalities. This overall project was a part of our construct week at Masai School.



## About Project
Toggl Track tracks time blocks, optionally labeled with a task, a project, and tags. Time can be tracked through a start/stop button, manual entry, or dragging and resizing time blocks in a calendar view. With the browser extension, Toggl Track has time tracking integrations with over 100 websites.


<b> And we cloned it for our construct week Project. </b>
